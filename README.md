its dark down here. the metal floor and walls are getting colder as the electricity runs dry. the things that came from the machine, they seem to be made of the same shit as sample 2b4n. a few of them took the others. Danse, Asahi, and everyone else. i think i may be the only person left. im not 100% sure though. They take them, and they- they- they turn them into these horrid abominations, just like what happened to Adonis...... I don't know how long im going to last in here, and i may have to leave. But if i do i'll have to take a drastic measure. We never tested project rewind, but its my last hope. -Atlas.
